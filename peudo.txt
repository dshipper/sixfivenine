Logic flow for Chat System

User presses find chat
The system looks for a chat that is in "waiting" status
If it finds one it sends back the chat id
If it doesn't it creates a chat, puts it into waiting mode and then sends back the chat id
The view pane checks the messages database every second for new messages with the chat id
The send pane sends chats with the chat message when the user presses enter
